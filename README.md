# sports-analytics-lab
Sports Analytics Lab is a fully end-to-end applied analytics project combining exploratory data analysis, predictive modelling, and interactive BI dashboards. The objective is to demonstrate how data science, football statistics, and machine learning can be used to evaluate historical performance and forecast future outcomes using real-world data.


## 📌 Overview

**Sports Analytics Lab** is an end-to-end applied data science project focused on transforming football performance data into **actionable insights**, **predictive forecasts**, and **professional analytics dashboards**.

The project demonstrates how **exploratory analysis, statistical modelling, machine learning algorithms, and Monte-Carlo simulation** can be combined with **interactive BI visualization** to support data-driven decision making in a real sports context.

This repository was developed as a **portfolio-grade showcase** of technical, analytical, and storytelling capabilities.
